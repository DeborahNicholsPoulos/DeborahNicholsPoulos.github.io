    <p class="text-section">&emsp;Deborah Nichols Poulos taught grades one through six over 27 years, including eight years in a self-contained fourth grade gifted class. During her first nine years, she taught a different grade—often in a different school—each year.  After those first years, she taught only grades four through six.  She did most of her teaching in Davis, California.
      <br><br>&emsp;As she gained experience and confidence, she started to develop her own strategies that she found yielded better results than what she had been taught—or, in many cases, had not been taught at all.  Having experience in many different grades during her early years of teaching prepared her to be flexible—and to develop techniques that she could use with students of any age or ability.
      <br><br>&emsp;Her husband has long urged her to write a book about what she had learned from teaching.  More recently her memoir group advocated this as well, pointing out that they thought her teaching ideas were compelling with unique perspectives.  The Conscious Teacher is the culmination of her efforts.</p>
