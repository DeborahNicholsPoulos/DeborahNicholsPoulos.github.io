  <h1 class="text-center">The Conscious Teacher</h1>
  <p class="text-section">
  The ideas I share in <i>The Conscious Teacher</i> have been in the back of my mind for a long time.  They have germinated since I retired from teaching in 2000.  My husband had been telling me for years that I needed to publish my teaching experiences so others could learn from them.

  <br><br>&emsp;It was in my memoir-writing group, however, that the project gathered momentum.  I had joined the group in 2013.  At first, like the others, I shared the writing I was doing to tell my life’s story.  But when the group learned I had written about my teaching, they wanted me to share that work instead.  Once I read the first excerpt, they urged me to set aside my autobiographical memoirs and focus instead on putting my teaching ideas into a book before it was too late.

  <br><br>&emsp;Having people enthusiastically support my work and say it was important enough to be published was in itself extremely encouraging.  But their saying “before it is too late” made me realize that they were right on point, bringing a sense of urgency to the task that I hadn’t felt before.  The fact is that I am living with an incurable illness that is going to take my life sooner rather than later, and I needed to prioritize.
  I have ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease).  It has slowly taken away my ability to control my muscles, and it will, before long, take my life.  My illness required me to retire early, and now I suddenly realized I shouldn’t delay any longer in writing the book and getting it published.
  It wasn’t as if it were a difficult task.  I didn’t have to study or do research.  All I had to do was reflect on my 27 years of teaching and write about what I had learned and put into practice.  In the fall of 2015 I picked up what I had begun a few years earlier and started writing in earnest

  <br><br>&emsp;To show what can happen when teachers allow students to slip through the cracks, I begin the book with <b>Part I—My Own Story</b>, about not really learning to read until I was in the 7th grade, and how I overcame this devastating failure and became a strong student.  (Not until after college did my Mom tell me that—as a five-year-old—I’d been tested as gifted.  I had gone through my first six grades not learning to read, thinking I was stupid.  Evidently my parents thought I was just lazy. And no teacher ever looked into why I couldn’t read.)
  There is no doubt that my early experiences in school gave me an insight into what can happen to bright students (or any student) through no fault of their own.   But these experiences were also behind my developing many of the ideas I later used in my own teaching.  I didn’t want any of <i>my</i> students to languish as I had with unaddressed issues, and I wanted <i>all</i> of my students to be taught in ways that allowed them to enjoy learning.

  <br><br>&emsp;The main part of the book, however, is what I learned from teaching:  <b>Part IV (First Things First:  Setting the Stage for Effective Learning)</b> and <b>Part V (Instruction in the Classroom)</b>, in which I discuss a variety of practices educators might use in each curriculum area to become more effective teachers.  These are unique approaches that are not normally found in teacher education courses, and many of which may even be new to veteran teachers.  Much of what I share was developed during my longest single teaching experience—eight years teaching a fourth grade gifted class.  But the methods that I learned there work just as well when teaching <i>any</i> students.

  <br><br>&emsp;First there are the general practices that are useful in all classes.  High among them are the importance of “knowing” each student before the first day of school, always treating students with dignity and respect, and using differentiated approaches to address all students’ unique learning needs.  I also describe my behavior management plan that works.

  <br><br>&emsp;And I emphasize why it is important to involve parents.  I provide a variety of examples of how to work with them (even those who challenge you or your methods), and I stress the importance of establishing a <i>parent-student-teacher team</i>, which I explain is like a three-legged stool:  each leg must do its part for optimal learning.
  I also suggest what I have found to be effective for teaching each standard subject in the elementary curriculum.  For example, basic to all teaching are reading and writing, and I show how even fourth grade students can learn to write five-paragraph essays, student-authored books, and research reports that include bibliographies.  Another example:  by integrating writing with social studies (i.e., by requiring good writing when working on reports and journals), a teacher can reinforce the principle that following established writing conventions is important across all subjects of the curriculum.  I have also expanded upon what is usually taught for art and drama.  For example, my fourth graders have performed Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet, Macbeth, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Julius Caesar</i>, and <i>King Lear</i>.  Young students are much more capable than many people realize.

  <br><br>&emsp;With the ideas I share in <i>The Conscious Teacher</i> as a foundation, I hope to inspire and empower other teachers to trust their insights and to confidently develop their own methods of engaging students in ways that both support and challenge them to reach their full potential.

  <br><br>&emsp;I hope <i>The Conscious Teacher</i> will become a guide for all <i>new</i> teachers, and I believe it will be an eye opener for many <i>experienced</i> teachers <i>and parents</i> as well.  In the end, this book is directed at all who are truly interested in giving children a positive and solid foundation in their elementary years.
  <i>The Conscious Teacher</i> is in its final stages of publication, and will be available for purchase soon. </p>
